MILESTONE PROJECT 2, INTERACTIVE FRONT END DEVELOPMENT, MEMORY GAME.

-The site is a simple card matching game in the theme of our planets.
-The objective is to match all 16 pairs within the 60 second time limit, the amount of times you flip a card over is also counted.
-a game for all audiences.



UX-

-The website is a single page with 3 overlays which are all extremely simple. when you load the page for a first time (or refresh the page) youll be presented with a simple click to start, you can click anywhere on the page to start the game, a similar thing will happen if you match all the cards or if you run out of time, an overlay will pop up saying you either matched all the cards or game over, both with a prompt to click to restart.


FEATURES-

-start game/ restart game overlay-
-time counter-
-card flip counter-
-card flipping animation-


FEATURES I COULD HAVE ADDED-

-if i had more time i would have mostlikely had a more dynamic overlay with more options, perhaps different difficulties or maybe even a scoreboard.

TECHNOLOGIES USED-

-this project uses HTML/CSS for the main page and the styling.
-uses Javascript for the actual game, shuffling the cards, restarting the game, counting the flips and the countdown timer.
